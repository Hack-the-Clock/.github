## **Track 1: Neurosymbolic AI**

**Theme:** Bring logic back into machine learning.  

**Overview:**  
Current ML and Transformer-based models have minimal room for improvement. They are often inefficient and struggle with logic-related tasks. This track focuses on combining **symbolic representations** (like knowledge graphs or rules) with machine learning to make AI that can reason as well as predict.  

**Focus Areas:**  
- Generate knowledge graphs with LLM support  
- Feed them into a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**  
- Translate GNN metrics into actions to update a knowledge base or document  
- Apply to structured systems requirements or similar domains  

**Inspiration:**  
Neural networks learn patterns. Symbolic systems understand meaning. The next generation of AI blends both.

## **Track 2: Vertical Applications (AI for Workforce and HR)**

**Theme:** Decode the unspoken side of human potential.  

**Overview:**  
With changes in DC, there is a growing focus on developing the local workforce. A system initially designed as a career coach has evolved into three applications, one targeting HR. Currently, it analyzes resumes and interviews but lacks insights from **non-verbal communication**.  

**Focus Areas:**  
- Analyze micro facial expressions  
- Analyze voice pitch and tone  
- Classify non-verbal cues to better profile candidates or employees  
- Integrate modules with HR or career coaching systems  

**Inspiration:**  
Resumes tell part of the story. Expressions and tone complete it.

## **Track 3: AI in Software Engineering**

**Theme:** Make code generation smarter, cleaner, and production-ready.  

**Overview:**  
LLMs can generate code for simple tasks, but complex, production-ready code often fails to meet **software engineering standards**. This track challenges teams to assess and improve generated code quality.  

**Focus Areas:**  
- Review existing AI tools and approaches to avoid reinventing the wheel  
- Build a software evaluator agent to assess generated code  
- Check for modularity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices  
- Score or benchmark LLM-generated code for production readiness  

**Inspiration:**  
Anyone can generate code. Engineers craft systems that last.
