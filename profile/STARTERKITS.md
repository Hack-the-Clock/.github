## 🧱 Starter Templates

Inside our [Hack-the-Clock GitHub Organization](https://github.com/hack-the-clock) you’ll find **ready-to-fork starter templates** to jumpstart your project.  
Each one includes setup instructions and a pre-configured development environment.

| Template | Stack | Ideal For |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 💻 **AI Web Starter** | Next.js + Express + OpenAI API | Building interactive AI web apps |
| 🧮 **Data Pipeline Starter** | Python + FastAPI + MongoDB/PostgreSQL | Data analysis, automation, or ML pipelines |

Each template includes:
- `README.md` with setup steps  
- `.env.example` for secrets

## ⚡ Pro Tips

- Clone your repo **before** kickoff so you don’t waste time on setup.  
- Use **GitHub Projects** or **Taskade** to divide tasks among teammates.  
- Keep your commits clean — every push before 8:20 PM counts.  
- Deploy early. Debugging a live app is faster than debugging an idea.  
- Use **AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT, Hugging Face)** ethically — cite what you use.

## 🔚 Final Note

This isn’t just a kit — it’s your runway.  
Build something bold, break something beautiful, and let AI do the heavy lifting.  

**12 hours. Infinite possibilities. Hack the Clock.** ⏳💥
